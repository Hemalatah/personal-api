personal-api
============

What It Does
-----------------------------
Provides a simple JSON API for your personal site. Easily hosted on (Heroku)[http://heroku.com].

Idea
-----------------------------
I saw [Joshua Beckman's](https://twitter.com/jbckmn) [peronal API](http://http://www.bckmn.com/api) and wanted to provide one that anyone can easily install.

Examples
-----------------------------
See [http://api.longren.org/](http://api.longren.org) or [http://http://www.bckmn.com/api](http://www.bckmn.com/api) for examples.

For PHP devs, there's some basic querying examples in php-examples.php. I'll be adding examples for JavaScript and maybe other languages as well, or send a pull request. Just name your example file ```ruby-example.rb``` for Ruby for example, or ```python-example.rb``` for Python.

Visit http://yourapp.herokuapp.com/php-example.php to see from ```php-example.php```.

Below is the output of (http://api.longren.org/php-example.php)[http://api.longren.org/php-example.php].
