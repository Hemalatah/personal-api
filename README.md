Status
-----------------------------
This is not ready. Don't even try using it, it won't work. I'll ahve a working version by Christmas 2013.

Idea
-----------------------------
I saw [Joshua Beckman's](https://twitter.com/jbckmn) [peronal API](http://http://www.bckmn.com/api) and wanted to provide one that anyone can easily install.

Example
-----------------------------
